# Work Directory

This folder contains *work-in-progress* artifacts for features and experiments, such as:

- Requirements and scope decisions
- Design notes and tradeoffs
- Backlog and task breakdown
- Progress logs / milestones
- Test plans and verification checklists

## Structure

- Each feature should get its own subfolder under `work/` (e.g. `work/analytics-codex/`).
- Keep documents small and focused. Prefer multiple short files over one giant doc.
- If a document is intended as a long-term reference, move it to `docs/` when it stabilizes.
